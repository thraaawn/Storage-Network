Fix items sometimes being deleted when using JEI to set a recipe into request table, while also having some items only on your hotbar and not in the network ( issue #16 ).

Storage Link Cable now has a GUI with Priority system and the whitelist/blacklist filter slots.  Also there is a new button that is only for Storage Link Cable GUI that allows you to set the connection as Output Only, meaning it will withdraw but not insert.  Tooltips now no longer hide behind the JEI screen.  Fix missing tooltip for Sort Direction button.  Fixed a bug to make sure cable upgrades now get dropped on the ground when the cable is broken.  Tightened up bounding box on the Storage Cable so it matches the model.  Improved performance and reduced some excess refresh calls (so crafting items and refreshing the grid are not as tightly coupled anymore).  Fixed the storage network from locking up the whole game when you are shift-click crafting (this was only noticeable in large modpacks with many many recipes, caused by a new recipe lookup search in each recipe iteration).  New config has been added to turn on benchmark logging in case future problems need to be detected, off by default. "
	,"1.2.1":"Fixed item loss bug related to shift-click crafting (was introduced in latest update 1.2.0, in newer forge versions).  "
